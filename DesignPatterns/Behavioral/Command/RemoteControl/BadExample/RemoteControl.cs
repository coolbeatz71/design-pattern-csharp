/// <b>Design Flaws in This Implementation:</b>
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>1. Violation of the Open/Closed Principle</b><br/>
/// The remote control must be modified every time a new light behavior is added (e.g., blinking, color changing).
/// This makes the class closed to extension and increases the risk of introducing bugs.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>2. Tight Coupling and Encapsulation Breach</b><br/>
/// The remote directly calls concrete methods on the <c>Light</c> class. This means it knows too much about how the light works,
/// leading to tight coupling and breaking encapsulation. Any change in the <c>Light</c> class could force changes here.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>3. Lack of Extensibility and Reusability</b><br/>
/// The current implementation works only with lights. Adding support for new devices like a fan or TV
/// would require rewriting this class or duplicating similar logic elsewhere.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>4. No Support for Action History or Undo</b><br/>
/// Actions are invoked immediately and directly. This design does not allow for queuing, logging, tracking,
/// or undoing operations â€” all of which are important in interactive systems like remote controls or UIs.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// A better approach would decouple the remote from specific device logic, enabling dynamic assignment of behavior
/// and supporting future features like command history or multi-device control.
