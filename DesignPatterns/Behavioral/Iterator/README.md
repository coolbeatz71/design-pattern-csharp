## 🔁 Iterator Pattern – How It Works

### 🧩 **Purpose**

The **Iterator Pattern** provides a **standard way to access the elements of a collection** sequentially **without exposing its internal structure**.

Instead of using indexes or exposing raw data structures like arrays or lists, it wraps the traversal logic in a dedicated object called an **iterator**. This makes iteration **consistent, reusable, and decoupled** from the actual collection logic.

### 🛠️ **Core Components**

1. **Iterator Interface**

    * Defines the operations for traversing a collection (e.g., `hasNext()`, `next()`).
    * Optionally includes methods like `reset()` or `current()` depending on the language or implementation.

2. **Concrete Iterator**

    * Implements the iterator interface for a specific collection.
    * Maintains the **current position** in the traversal.

3. **Aggregate (Collection) Interface**

    * Declares a method to **create an iterator** for its elements.

4. **Concrete Aggregate**

    * Implements the aggregate interface.
    * Returns an instance of its corresponding iterator.

### 🔄 **How It Works – Step-by-Step**

1. A collection class provides a method that returns an iterator.
2. The client uses the iterator to **step through elements**, one at a time.
3. The internal structure (array, list, tree, graph) is **completely hidden** from the client.
4. The same traversal logic works for **different types of collections**.

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Think of a **TV remote control**:

* You don’t need to know how channels are stored internally.
* The remote (iterator) gives you a way to **go next, previous, or select** a channel.
* It lets you **browse channels** consistently whether the internal storage is a list, database, or streaming source.

### 🔧 Without vs With Iterator Pattern

Without the Iterator pattern:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < playlist.Count; i++)
{
    var song = playlist[i];
    Play(song);
}
```

With the Iterator pattern:

```csharp
var iterator = playlist.CreateIterator();
while (iterator.HasNext())
{
    var song = iterator.Next();
    Play(song);
}
```

✅ This abstracts away how the `playlist` stores songs and ensures **uniform traversal**.

### 📌 When to Use

* When you need to **traverse different types of collections** with the same code.
* When the internal structure of a collection should be **hidden from the client**.
* When you want **multiple simultaneous traversals** without interference.
* When you're implementing **custom data structures** (e.g., trees, graphs) and need a standard way to iterate over them.
